# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life implementation in Python based on NeuralNine YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRWg2SWuXtM&t=622s). 

Program takes one positional argument in form of a string according to the common Game of Life rules notation (numbers required to keep a cell alive/numbers required to bring a cell to life).

For example:
python3 main.py 23/3 - for Conway's rule.
